/* READ ME : zx_kernel */

This directory contains the files of zx_kernel_code

The directory structure is as follows

./src     - c source files
./include - header files
./bin     - compiler generated binaries (.elf file )
./obj     - compiler generated object files (.obj files )
./asm     - compiler generated assembly files ( .asm files )

the makefile generates executable for arm3 CPU. To generate
the executable, run the makefile in this directory. You could
do 

1. make clean  - to delete all compiler generated files from 
	        previous compilation
2. make        - build source and produce executable
3. make upload - make + upload the executable to tftp server
